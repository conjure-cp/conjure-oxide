Model before rewriting:

find x: int(1..5)

such that

(x < 2)

--

(x < 2), 
   ~~> lt_to_leq ([("Minion", 8400)]) 
(x <= sum([2,-1;int(1..)])) 

--

(x <= sum([2,-1;int(1..)])), 
   ~~> constant_evaluator ([("Constant", 9001)]) 
(x <= 1) 

--

(x <= 1), 
   ~~> leq_to_ineq ([("Minion", 4100)]) 
Ineq(x, 1, 0) 

--

Final model:

find x: int(1..5)

such that

Ineq(x, 1, 0)
