$ 4-queens:

$ Say, arbitrarily, that queen 0 is in column 0, queen 1 in column 1, ...
$
$ So each queen, q, has some position (q,row[q]) on the board.

find row: matrix indexed by [ int(0..7) ] of  int(0..7)

$ Queens are different iff:

$ * they are all in different columns 
$
$ * they are all on different major diagonals (column+row) 
$
$ * they are all on different minor diagonals (column-row) 


$ possible minor diagonals are in the domain (0-3)..(3-0) 
find minorDiagonal: matrix indexed by [ int(0..3) ] of int(-3..3)

$ possible major diagonals are in the domain (0+0)..(3+3)
