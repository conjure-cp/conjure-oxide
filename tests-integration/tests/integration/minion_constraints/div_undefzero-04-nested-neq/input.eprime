language ESSENCE' 1.0

$ as with 03, but testing the rules that flatten divneqs.
$
$ these appear a lot with nested divs, because of the additional definedness
$ constraints we add. For example:
$
$ x/(y/z) ~[safe-div]-> x / (y/z) /\ (y/z) != 0 
$
$ ... 
find x : int(5..20)
find y : int(0..5)
find z : int(0..6)

such that x / (y/z) != 10
