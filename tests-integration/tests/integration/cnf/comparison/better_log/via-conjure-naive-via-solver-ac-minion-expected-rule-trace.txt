Model before rewriting:

find c1: int(1..3)
find c2: int(1..3)
find c3: int(1..3)
find c4: int(1..3)
find c5: int(1..3)

such that

(c1 != c2),
(c1 != c3),
(c2 != c3),
(c2 != c4),
(c3 != c4),
(c3 != c5),
(c4 != c5)

--

Final model:

find c1: int(1..3)
find c2: int(1..3)
find c3: int(1..3)
find c4: int(1..3)
find c5: int(1..3)

such that

(c1 != c2),
(c1 != c3),
(c2 != c3),
(c2 != c4),
(c3 != c4),
(c3 != c5),
(c4 != c5)
