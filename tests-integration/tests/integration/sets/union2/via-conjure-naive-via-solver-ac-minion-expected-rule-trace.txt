Model before rewriting:

find x: int(1..5)

such that

x in ({0,1,2} union {3,4,5})

--

x in ({0,1,2} union {3,4,5}), 
   ~~> constant_evaluator ([("Constant", 9001)])
x in Set([Int(0), Int(1), Int(2), Int(3), Int(4), Int(5)])

--

x in Set([Int(0), Int(1), Int(2), Int(3), Int(4), Int(5)]), 
   ~~> in_set ([("Minion", 1)])
__minion_w_inset(x,[0,1,2,3,4,5])

--

Final model:

find x: int(1..5)

such that

__minion_w_inset(x,[0,1,2,3,4,5])
