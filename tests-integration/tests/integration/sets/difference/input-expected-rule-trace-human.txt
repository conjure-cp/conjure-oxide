Model before rewriting:

find c: set of (int(1..3))

such that

(c = ({1,2,3} - {2}))

--

(c = ({1,2,3} - {2})), 
   ~~> constant_evaluator ([("Constant", 9001)]) 
(c = (Set([Int(1), Int(2), Int(3)]) - Set([Int(2)]))) 

--

Final model:

find c: set of (int(1..3))

such that

(c = (Set([Int(1), Int(2), Int(3)]) - Set([Int(2)])))
