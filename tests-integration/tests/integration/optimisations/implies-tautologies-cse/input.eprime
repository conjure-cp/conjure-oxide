$ a simpler version can be found in basic/implies/03-tautologies

find x,y,z,a,b,c,d,e: bool

find l,m,n,o,p,q,r: int(1..10)

such that

$ all tautologies: should partially evaluate to true and never get to Minion

$ p -> p ~> true (reflexivity)
x -> x,

$ (p->q) \/ (q->p) ~> true (totality)
(a->z) \/ (z->a),

$ (p->q) \/ (p-> !q) ~> true (conditional excluded middle)
(b->c) \/ (b -> !c),

$ non-trivial variations of the above 
$
$ tests CSE, variable unification, etc.
$
$ we probably will never reduce all these fully! (some of the reductions needed
$ might be too expensive to be worth it)

$ non-flat, syntactically identical reflexivity
(l = 10) -> (l = 10),

$ non-flat, syntactically identical totality
((n < 6) -> (m %2 = 0)) \/ ((m % 2 = 0) -> (n < 6)),

$ totality with extra stuff in the disjunction
((n < 6) -> (m %2 = 0)) \/ a \/ b \/ ((m % 2 = 0) -> (n < 6)),

$ totality but with intermediate, identical variables
o = n,
d = (n < 6),
p = m % 2,

((o < 6) -> (p = 0)) \/ ((m % 2 = 0) -> d),

$ above but also with some extra stuff in the disjunction
((o < 6) -> (p = 0)) \/ a \/ b \/ ((m % 2 = 0) -> d),

$ non-flat, syntactically identical conditional excluded middle 
((q/2 =r) -> (n < 6)) \/ ((q/2 = r) -> !(n<6)),

$ conditional excluded middle with some extra stuff in the conjunction
((q/2 =r) -> (n < 6)) \/ a \/ b \/ ((q/2 = r) -> !(n<6))
