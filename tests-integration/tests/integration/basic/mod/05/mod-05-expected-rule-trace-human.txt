Model before rewriting:

find a: int(0..3)
find b: int(0..3)
find c: int(0..3)

such that

(a != b % c)

--

b % c, 
   ~~> mod_to_bubble ([("Bubble", 6000)]) 
{SafeMod(b,c) @ (c != 0)} 

--

(a != {SafeMod(b,c) @ (c != 0)}), 
   ~~> bubble_up ([("Bubble", 8800)]) 
{(a != SafeMod(b,c)) @ (c != 0)} 

--

{(a != SafeMod(b,c)) @ (c != 0)}, 
   ~~> expand_bubble ([("Bubble", 8900)]) 
and([(a != SafeMod(b,c)),(c != 0);int(1..)]) 

--

and([(a != SafeMod(b,c)),(c != 0);int(1..)]), 
   ~~> constant_evaluator ([("Constant", 9001)]) 
(a != SafeMod(b,c)),
(c != 0) 

--

(a != SafeMod(b,c)), 
   ~~> flatten_generic ([("Minion", 4200)]) 
(a != __0) 
new variables:
  find __0: int(0..2)
new constraints:
  __0 =aux SafeMod(b,c)
--

__0 =aux SafeMod(b,c), 
   ~~> introduce_modeq ([("Minion", 4200)]) 
ModEq(b, c, __0) 

--

Final model:

find a: int(0..3)
find b: int(0..3)
find c: int(0..3)
find __0: int(0..2)

such that

(a != __0),
(c != 0),
ModEq(b, c, __0)
