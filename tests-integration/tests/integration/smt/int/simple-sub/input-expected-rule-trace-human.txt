Model before rewriting:

find x: int(1..20)
find y: int(1..20)

such that

((y - x) = 3),
(sum([x,x;int(1..2)]) = y)

--

(y - x), 
   ~~> minus_to_sum ([("Base", 8400)]) 
sum([y,-(x);int(1..)]) 

--

sum([x,x;int(1..2)]), 
   ~~> matrix_to_list ([("Base", 2000)]) 
sum([x,x;int(1..)]) 

--

Final model:

find x: int(1..20)
find y: int(1..20)

such that

(sum([y,-(x);int(1..)]) = 3),
(sum([x,x;int(1..)]) = y)
