Model before rewriting:

find a: set (minSize(1)) of int(1..2)
find b: set (minSize(1)) of int(1..2)

such that

(a = b)

--

(a = b), 
   ~~> unwrap_set_eq ([("Smt", 8801)]) 
and([(1 in a) <-> (1 in b),(2 in a) <-> (2 in b);int(1..)]) 

--

and([(1 in a) <-> (1 in b),(2 in a) <-> (2 in b);int(1..)]), 
   ~~> constant_evaluator ([("Constant", 9001)]) 
(1 in a) <-> (1 in b),
(2 in a) <-> (2 in b) 

--

Final model:

find a: set (minSize(1)) of int(1..2)
find b: set (minSize(1)) of int(1..2)

such that

(1 in a) <-> (1 in b),
(2 in a) <-> (2 in b)
