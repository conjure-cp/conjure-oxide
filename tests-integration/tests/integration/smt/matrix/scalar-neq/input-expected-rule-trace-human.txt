Model before rewriting:

find m: matrix indexed by [[int(1)]] of bool
find m2: matrix indexed by [[int(1)]] of bool

such that

(m != m2)

--

(m != m2), 
   ~~> flatten_matrix_eq_neq ([("Smt", 1000)]) 
or([(m[1] != m2[1]);int(1..)]) 

--

or([(m[1] != m2[1]);int(1..)]), 
   ~~> remove_unit_vector_or ([("Base", 8800)]) 
(m[1] != m2[1]) 

--

Final model:

find m: matrix indexed by [[int(1)]] of bool
find m2: matrix indexed by [[int(1)]] of bool

such that

(m[1] != m2[1])
