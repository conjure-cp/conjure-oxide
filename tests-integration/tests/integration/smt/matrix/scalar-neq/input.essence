language Essence 1. 3

find    m : matrix indexed by [int(1)] of bool

find    m2 : matrix indexed by [int(1)] of bool

$ Since SMT arrays can always be expanded, the solver might find arrays which are identical

$ in the way we care about, but different outside the matrix's index domain

such that m != m2
