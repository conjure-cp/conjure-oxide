$ how much it costs to make a pen 
find cost: int(1..3)

$ how much COâ‚‚ is emitted during the production of a pen
find co2: int(1..3)

$ we aim to find the lowest cost and the lowest emissions

such that

$ after finding the first solution {3, 3}, we add a constraint to search only for non-dominated solutions.
cost * co2 < 3*3
