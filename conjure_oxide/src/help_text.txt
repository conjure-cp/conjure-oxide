LOGGING

The following options control the logging output of Conjure Oxide:

1. --verbose
2. the RUST_LOG environment variable

--verbose changes the formatting of the logs for improved readability,
including printing source locations and line numbers for log events. It also
enables the printing of the log levels INFO and above.

The RUST_LOG environment variable can be used to further customise the log
levels that are printed. This can be different per module. For more information,
see: https://docs.rs/env_logger/latest/env_logger/#enabling-logging.

LOGGING RULE TRACES

* INFO provides information on the rules that were applied to the model. 

* TRACE additionally prints the rules that were attempted and why they were not
  applicable. 


For example, to see TRACE logs in a pretty format (mainly useful for
debugging):

    $ RUST_LOG=trace conjure-oxide solve --verbose <model>

    # or through cargo:
    $ RUST_LOG=trace cargo run -- solve --verbose <model>
