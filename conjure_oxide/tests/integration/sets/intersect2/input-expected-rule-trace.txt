Model before rewriting:

letting a be {2,3}
letting b be {1,2}
find c: set of (int(1..3))

such that

(c = (a intersect b))

--

Successful Tranformation: 
a, 
~~> substitute_value_lettings [5000; Base]
{2,3}


--

Successful Tranformation: 
b, 
~~> substitute_value_lettings [5000; Base]
{1,2}

Final model:

letting a be {2,3}
letting b be {1,2}
find c: set of (int(1..3))

such that

(c = ({2,3} intersect {1,2}))
