Model before rewriting:

find A: set of (int(1..4))
find B: set of (int(1..4))
find C: set of (int(1..4))

such that

A subseteq B union C union C

--

A subseteq B union C union C, 
   ~~> subset_eq ([("Base", 8600)]) 
and([i in B union C union C | i <- A,]) 

--

, 
   ~~> eval_root ([("Constant", 9001)]) 
true 

--

Final model:

find A: set of (int(1..4))
find B: set of (int(1..4))
find C: set of (int(1..4))

such that

and([i in B union C union C | i <- A,true])
