Model before rewriting:

find A: set of (int(1..4))
find B: set of (int(1..4))
find C: set of (int(1..4))

such that

A intersect C intersect C subseteq B

--

A intersect C intersect C subseteq B, 
   ~~> split_intersection_subseteq ([("Base", 8601)]) 
and([(i in A intersect C) -> (i in B) | i <- C,]) 

--

, 
   ~~> eval_root ([("Constant", 9001)]) 
true 

--

Final model:

find A: set of (int(1..4))
find B: set of (int(1..4))
find C: set of (int(1..4))

such that

and([(i in A intersect C) -> (i in B) | i <- C,true])
