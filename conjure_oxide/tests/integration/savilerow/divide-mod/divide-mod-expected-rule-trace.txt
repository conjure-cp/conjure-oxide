Model before rewriting:

find x: int(1..1)

such that

(UnsafeDiv(3, 2) = 1),
(UnsafeDiv(-(3), 2) = -(2)),
(UnsafeDiv(3, -(2)) = -(2)),
(UnsafeDiv(-(3), -(2)) = 1),
(3 % 2 = 1),
(3 % -(2) = -(1)),
(-(3) % 2 = 1),
(-(3) % -(2) = -(1)),
true

Successful Tranformation: 
(UnsafeDiv(3, 2) = 1),
(UnsafeDiv(-(3), 2) = -(2)),
(UnsafeDiv(3, -(2)) = -(2)),
(UnsafeDiv(-(3), -(2)) = 1),
(3 % 2 = 1),
(3 % -(2) = -(1)),
(-(3) % 2 = 1),
(-(3) % -(2) = -(1)),

Final model:
