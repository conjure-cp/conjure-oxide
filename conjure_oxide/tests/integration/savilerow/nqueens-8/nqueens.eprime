$ modified from savile rows' nqueens test.

letting    AMOUNT_QUEENS be domain int(0..7)
find       q1: matrix indexed by [ AMOUNT_QUEENS ] of int(0..7)
find       q2: matrix indexed by [ AMOUNT_QUEENS ] of int(-7..7)
find       q3: matrix indexed by [ AMOUNT_QUEENS ] of int(0..14)

such that  allDiff(q1), 
           allDiff(q2), 
           allDiff(q3),
           
         $ diagonals
           forAll i : AMOUNT_QUEENS . (
               (q2[i]=q1[i]-i)  /\
               (q3[i]=q1[i]+i)
           )
