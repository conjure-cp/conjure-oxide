Model before rewriting:

find a: int(1..2)
letting n be 2

such that

(a < n)

--

Successful Tranformation: 
(a < n), 
~~> lt_to_leq [8400; Minion]
(a <= Sum([n,-1;int(1..)]))  
--

Successful Tranformation: 
n, 
~~> substitute_value_lettings [5000; Base]
2  
--

Successful Tranformation: 
Sum([2,-1;int(1..)]), 
~~> constant_evaluator [9001; Constant]

Final model:

find a: int(1..2)
letting n be 2

such that

Ineq(a, 1, 0)
