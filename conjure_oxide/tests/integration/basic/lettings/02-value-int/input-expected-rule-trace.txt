Model before rewriting:

letting A be 3
find b: int(1..20)

such that

(b < A)

--

Successful Tranformation: 
(b < A), 
~~> lt_to_leq [8400; Minion]
(b <= Sum([A,-1;int(1..)]))


--

Successful Tranformation: 
A, 
~~> substitute_value_lettings [5000; Base]
3


--

Successful Tranformation: 
Sum([3,-1;int(1..)]), 
~~> constant_evaluator [9001; Constant]
2

Successful Tranformation: 
(b <= 2), 
~~> leq_to_ineq [4100; Minion]
Ineq(b, 2, 0)

Final model:

letting A be 3
find b: int(1..20)

such that

Ineq(b, 2, 0)
