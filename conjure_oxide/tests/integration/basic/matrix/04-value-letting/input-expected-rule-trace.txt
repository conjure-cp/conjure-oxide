Model before rewriting:

letting a be [[1,2,3;int(1..3)],[4,5,6;int(1..3)],[7,8,9;int(1..3)];int(1..3)]
find b: int(1..10)

such that

(b > a[3, 3])

--

Successful Tranformation: 
(b > a[3, 3]), 
~~> gt_to_geq [8400; Minion]
(Sum([b,-1;int(1..)]) >= a[3, 3])

Successful Tranformation:

~~> substitute_value_lettings [5000; Base]
[[1,2,3;int(1..3)],[4,5,6;int(1..3)],[7,8,9;int(1..3)];int(1..3)]

Final model:

letting a be [[1,2,3;int(1..3)],[4,5,6;int(1..3)],[7,8,9;int(1..3)];int(1..3)]
find b: int(1..10)

such that

Ineq(9, b, -1)
