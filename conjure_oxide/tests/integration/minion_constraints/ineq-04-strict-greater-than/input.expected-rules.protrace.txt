Model before rewriting:

find x: int(1..4)
find y: int(1..4)

such that

(y > x)

--

Successful Tranformation: 
(y > x), 
~~> gt_to_geq [8400; Minion]
(Sum([y,-1;int(1..)]) >= x)  
--

Successful Tranformation: 
(Sum([y,-1;int(1..)]) >= x), 
~~> y_plus_k_geq_x_to_ineq [4800; Minion]
Ineq(x, y, -1)

Final model:

find x: int(1..4)
find y: int(1..4)

such that

Ineq(x, y, -1)
