Model before rewriting:

find x: int(1..4)
find y: int(1..4)

such that

(x < y)

--

(x < y), 
   ~~> lt_to_leq ([("Minion", 8400)]) 
(x <= Sum([y, -1])) 

--

(x <= Sum([y, -1])), 
   ~~> x_leq_y_plus_k_to_ineq ([("Minion", 4500)]) 
Ineq(x, y, -1) 

--

Final model:

find x: int(1..4)
find y: int(1..4)

such that

Ineq(x, y, -1)
