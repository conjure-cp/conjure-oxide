Model before rewriting:

find x: int(1..4)
find y: int(1..4)

such that

(x < y)

--

Successful Tranformation: 
(x < y), 
~~> lt_to_leq [8400; Minion]
(x <= Sum([y,-1;int(1..)]))


--

Successful Tranformation: 
(x <= Sum([y,-1;int(1..)])), 
~~> introduce_weighted_sumleq_sumgeq [4600; Minion]

Final model:

find x: int(1..4)
find y: int(1..4)

such that

SumGeq([y, -1], x)
