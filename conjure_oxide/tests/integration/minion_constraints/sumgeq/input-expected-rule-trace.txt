Model before rewriting:

find x: int(1..3)
find y: int(1..3)
find z: int(1..5)

such that

(Sum([x,y;int(1..2)]) >= z)

Successful Tranformation: 
Sum([x,y;int(1..2)]), 
~~> matrix_to_list [2000; Base]
Sum([x,y;int(1..)])

Final model:

find x: int(1..3)
find y: int(1..3)
find z: int(1..5)

such that

SumGeq([x, y], z)
