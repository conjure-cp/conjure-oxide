Model before rewriting:

find x: int(1..4)
find y: int(1..4)

such that

((y - 1) >= x),
(Sum([-(1),y;int(1..2)]) >= x)

--

Successful Tranformation: 
-(1), 
~~> constant_evaluator [9001; Constant]

Successful Tranformation:

~~> minus_to_sum [8400; Base]
Sum([y,-(1);int(1..)])

Successful Tranformation:

Final model:

find x: int(1..4)
find y: int(1..4)

such that

Ineq(x, y, -1),
Ineq(x, y, -1)
