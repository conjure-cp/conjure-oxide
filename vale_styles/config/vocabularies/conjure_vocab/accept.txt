# The idea behind this file is to list all the words that are accepted in the codebase, but are not necessarily in the dictionary. # This is useful for words that are specific to the domain of the codebase, or for words that are commonly used but not necessarily 
# in the dictionary. The words in this file will be added to the dictionary when running the spell checker, so they will not be 
# flagged as misspelled.

# It supports the usage of regexes, as established by: https://vale.sh/docs/keys/vocab#file-format
