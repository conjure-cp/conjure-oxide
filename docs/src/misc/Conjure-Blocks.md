\# Conjure Blocks



This is a side project to Conjure-Oxide. 



An online block editor for Essence. You can write constraint programs in blocks, that are translated to Essence. [Conjure-aaS](https://conjure-aas.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/) is used to solve these problems. 



See the [repo](https://github.com/conjure-cp/conjure-blocks), and [live site](https://conjure-cp.github.io/conjure-blocks/) for more information.
