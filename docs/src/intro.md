# Conjure Oxide

Welcome to the documentation of Conjure Oxide, a next generation constraints
modelling tool written in Rust. It supports models written in the Essence and
Essence Prime constraints modelling languages.

Conjure Oxide is in the early stages of development, so most Essence language
features are not supported yet. However, it does currently support most of
Essence Prime.

This site contains the user documentation for Conjure Oxide; other useful links can be found on the [useful links](./links.md) page.
