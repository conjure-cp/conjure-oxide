# Description of the in prograss teams section

<!-- TODO: ensure folder names are acceptable. -->

This is a section where people can compile documentation and information that is useful and relavant to their current projects.

The order with which these files are in dont matter, as everything is currently a draft until an editor reviews it and gives it a proper place in the documentation.
