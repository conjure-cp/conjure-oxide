# Contributors Guide

This section is dedicated to individuals who are interested in **contributing** to Conjure Oxide. 

This project is entirely open-source, with all code released under the [MPL 2.0](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/) license, unless stated otherwise. Currently, Conjure Oxide has been mainly developed by students and staff at the [University of St Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/). However, we welcome and encourage contributions from individuals outside the University. 

Over the course of this section, we will discuss the following:
- How to set up your development environment.
- How to begin contributing.
- General guidelines you should follow when contributing.
- Conventions that we use in our development process.
- Common issues, with potential fixes.

For those new to conjure, and rust, we have also provided links to useful resources that will develop your understanding which you can view [here]().
