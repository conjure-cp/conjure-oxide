# How We Work

This is our Constitution, but in contrast to a real constitution of a company we intend this document to be a living document. Please feel free to suggest edits and improvements.

## Principles

- [Assume good faith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_faith).
- Take responsibility for your work.
- Look for opportunites to help others.
- Make it easy for others to help you.

## Social contract

We agree to adhere to the following guidelines when engaging in group work. 

- We communicate in English as a common, shared language.
- We include all group members in meetings, group chats, messages, and social events.
- We turn up on time to meetings.
- We pay attention and contribute to group discussions. 
- We contribute to the group tasks.
- We listen to each other’s opinions. 
- We share ideas and do not disregard other people’s thoughts or feelings.
- We are respectful towards one another and treat each other with care and courtesy.
- We complete tasks on time and to the best of our ability.
- We do not make assumptions about individual abilities.


## Logistics

- **GitHub**: We use GitHub as our main platform for code collaboration and version control.
- **Teams**: We use Teams for day to day communications.
- **Weekly report**: We use a web form to provide an update to the supervisors every week. This is not assessed and doesn't strictly follow the reflective writing methods. However, [this resource on the Gibbs reflective cycle](https://reflection.ed.ac.uk/reflectors-toolkit/reflecting-on-experience/gibbs-reflective-cycle) may still be helpful when approaching the weekly form and how to use the form effectively.
- **Weekly meetings**: The whole group meets once a week. Before this meeting everyone fills in the weekly report. We take minutes at these meetings.


## Best Practices for Collaboration

### 1. Start with Early Pull Requests (PRs)
   - Don’t wait until everything is perfect; submitting early PRs allows the team to provide feedback sooner. This helps catch potential issues early and encourages collaboration.
   - Even if your code isn’t complete, opening a draft PR can be a good way to start discussions and ensure alignment.

### 2. Show, Don’t Tell
   - Share your experiences and insights! Use GitHub or Microsoft Teams to share updates, challenges, and breakthroughs with the rest of the team.
   - Showing real examples means other can more easily help you, it can help others understand your approach and may inspire new ideas.
   - High-level explanations can inadvertantly hide important details. Showing the actual artefact (whether it's code, a design document or something else) together with your high-level commentary eliminates this risk.

### 3. Begin with Specifications
   - Before you start coding, document your plan. Write out specifications or create a rough outline of what you're working on, including examples where possible.
   - Having a clear plan makes it easier to get feedback and helps others understand the purpose and scope of your work.

### 4. Share Failures as Much as Successes
   - When something doesn’t work, share it! Learning from mistakes and discussing setbacks is invaluable.
   - A failed attempt can often be as educational as a successful one, and it may prevent others from encountering the same issue.

### 5. Ask Good Questions
   - Don’t hesitate to reach out when you're stuck, but try to ask thoughtful, specific questions.
   - Providing context and sharing what you've tried will help others give more helpful answers.

## Final Thoughts
- **Collaboration** is key to our success, so feel free to communicate openly.
- **Continuous improvement** is encouraged—keep looking for ways to improve your code, processes, and knowledge.
