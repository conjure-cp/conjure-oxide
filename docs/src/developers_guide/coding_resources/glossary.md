- Branch: A branch is a parallel version of a repository. It does not affect the primary or main branch. 

- RFC: Request for Comments. It is a design proposal, often written before or alongside major changes.

- Essence: A high level constraint modelling language, which focuses on what the problem is rather than how to solve it. It's high level problem descriptions.

- Conjure: Constraint modelling tool that translates Essence problem descriptions into Essence' models that constraint solvers can execute.  

- Essence' (Essence prime): Intermediate representation automatically generated by Conjure

- Savile Row: It transforms high level Essence' constraint models and outputs solver-specific model that can be executed. Written in Java.

- Minion: Constraint solver. It takes low level constraint models (like Savile Row output) and searches for solutions.
