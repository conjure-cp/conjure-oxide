/// Rewrites a `Model` by applying rule sets using an optimized, tree-morphing rewriter.
///
/// This function traverses the expression tree of the model and applies the given rules
/// to transform it. It operates on the model's internal structure, replacing the root
/// expression and updating the symbol table based on the transformations performed by the
/// `morph` function.
///
/// # Parameters
///
/// - `model`: The `Model` to be rewritten. It is consumed and a new, transformed version is returned.
/// - `rule_sets`: A vector of `RuleSet` references containing the rules for transformation. These rules are grouped by priority before being applied.
/// - `prop_multiple_equally_applicable`: A boolean flag to control behavior when multiple rules of the same priority can be applied to the same expression.
///   - If `true`, the rewriter will use a selection strategy (`select_panic`) that panics.
///   - If `false`, the rewriter will use a selection strategy (`select_first`) that simply picks the first applicable rule it encounters.
///
/// # Returns
///
/// The rewritten `Model` after all applicable rules have been applied.
///
/// # Panics
///
/// This function will panic under two conditions:
/// - If the internal grouping of rules by priority fails (from `get_rules_grouped`).
/// - If `prop_multiple_equally_applicable` is set to `true` and more than one rule of the same priority can be applied to the same expression.
