/// Exhaustively rewrites a tree using a set of transformation rules.
///
/// Rewriting is complete when all rules have been attempted with no change. Rules may be organised
/// into groups to control the order in which they are attempted.
///
/// # Rule Groups
/// If all rules are treated equally, those which apply higher in the tree will take precedence
/// because of the left-most outer-most traversal order of the engine.
///
/// This can cause problems if a rule which should ideally be applied early (e.g. evaluating
/// constant expressions) is left until later.
///
/// To solve this, rules can be organised into different collections in the `groups` argument.
/// The engine will apply rules in an earlier group to the entire tree before trying later groups.
/// That is, no rule is attempted if a rule in an earlier group is applicable to any part of the
/// tree.
///
/// # Selector Functions
///
/// If multiple rules in the same group are applicable to an expression, the user-defined
/// selector function is used to choose one. This function is given an iterator over pairs of
/// rules and the engine-created [`Update`] values which contain their modifications to the tree.
///
/// Some useful selector functions are available in the [`helpers`](crate::helpers) module. One
/// common function is [`select_first`](crate::helpers::select_first), which simply returns the
/// first applicable rule.
///
/// # Optimizations
///
/// To optimize the morph function, we use a dirty/clean approach. Since whether a rule applies
/// is purely a function of a node and its children, rules should only be checked once unless a node
/// or one of its children has been changed. To enforce this we use a skeleton tree approach, which
/// keeps track of the current level of which a node has had a rule check applied.
/// # Example
/// ```rust
/// use tree_morph::{prelude::*, helpers::select_panic};
/// use uniplate::derive::Uniplate;
