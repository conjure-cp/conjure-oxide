/// Converts a matrix to a list if possible.
///
/// A list is a matrix with the unbounded domain `int(1..)`. Unlike matrices in general, lists can
/// be resized; consequently, a lot more rules apply to them.
///
/// A matrix can be converted to a list if:
///
///  1. It has some contiguous domain `int(1..n)`.
///
///  2. It is a matrix literal (i.e. not a reference to a decision variable).
///
///  3. Its direct parent is a constraint, not another matrix or `AbstractLiteral`.
///
///    This prevents the conversion of rows in a 2d matrix from being turned into lists. If were
///    to happen, the rows of the matrix might become different lengths, which is invalid!
///
///  4. The matrix is stored as `Expression` type inside (i.e. not as an `Atom` inside a Minion
///     constraint)
///
/// Because of condition 4, and this rules low priority, this rule will not run post-flattening, so
/// matrices that do not need to be converted to lists in order to get them ready for Minion will
/// be left alone.
