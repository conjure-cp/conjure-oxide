//! A high-level API for interacting with constraints solvers.
//!
//! This module provides a consistent, solver-independent API for interacting with constraints
//! solvers. It also provides incremental solving support, and the returning of run stats from
//! solvers.
//!
//! -----
//!
//! - [Solver<Adaptor>] provides the API for interacting with constraints solvers.
//!
//! - The [SolverAdaptor] trait controls how solving actually occurs and handles translation
//!   between the [Solver] type and a specific solver.
//!
//! - [adaptors] contains all implemented solver adaptors.
//!
//! - The [model_modifier] submodule defines types to help with incremental solving / changing a
//!   model during search. The entrypoint for incremental solving is the [Solver<A,ModelLoaded>::solve_mut]
//!   function.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ## A Successful Minion Model
//!
//! Note: this example constructs a basic Minion-compatible model instead of using the rewriter.
//! For a full end-to-end example, see conjure_oxide/examples/solver_hello_minion.rs
//!
//! ```rust
//! use std::sync::{Arc,Mutex};
//! use conjure_core::parse::get_example_model;
//! use conjure_core::rule_engine::resolve_rule_sets;
//! use conjure_core::rule_engine::rewrite_naive;
//! use conjure_core::solver::{adaptors, Solver, SolverAdaptor};
//! use conjure_core::solver::states::ModelLoaded;
//! use conjure_core::Model;
//! use conjure_core::ast::Domain;
//! use conjure_core::ast::Declaration;
//! use conjure_core::solver::SolverFamily;
//! use conjure_core::context::Context;
//! use conjure_essence_macros::essence_expr;
//!
//! // Define a model for minion.
//! let context = Context::<'static>::new_ptr_empty(SolverFamily::Minion);
//! let mut model = Model::new(context);
//! model.as_submodel_mut().add_symbol(Declaration::new_var("x".into(), Domain::BoolDomain));
//! model.as_submodel_mut().add_symbol(Declaration::new_var("y".into(), Domain::BoolDomain));
//! model.as_submodel_mut().add_constraint(essence_expr!{x != y});
//!
//! // Solve using Minion.
//! let solver = Solver::new(adaptors::Minion::new());
//! let solver: Solver<adaptors::Minion,ModelLoaded> = solver.load_model(model).unwrap();
//!
//! // In this example, we will count solutions.
//! //
//! // The solver interface is designed to allow adaptors to use multiple-threads / processes if
//! // necessary. Therefore, the callback type requires all variables inside it to have a static
//! // lifetime and to implement Send (i.e. the variable can be safely shared between theads).
//! //
//! // We use Arc<Mutex<T>> to create multiple references to a threadsafe mutable
//! // variable of type T.
//! //
//! // Using the move |x| ... closure syntax, we move one of these references into the closure.
//! // Note that a normal closure borrow variables from the parent so is not
//! // thread-safe.
//!
//! let counter_ref = Arc::new(Mutex::new(0));
//! let counter_ref_2 = counter_ref.clone();
//! solver.solve(Box::new(move |_| {
//!   let mut counter = (*counter_ref_2).lock().unwrap();
//!   *counter += 1;
//!   true
//!   }));
//!
//! let mut counter = (*counter_ref).lock().unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(*counter,2);
//! ```
//!
//! # The Solver callback function
//!
//! The callback function given to `solve` is called whenever a solution is found by the solver.
//!
//! Its return value can be used to control how many solutions the solver finds:
//!
//! * If the callback function returns `true`, solver execution continues.
//! * If the callback function returns `false`, the solver is terminated.
//!

// # Implementing Solver interfaces
//
// Solver interfaces can only be implemented inside this module, due to the SolverAdaptor crate
// being sealed.
//
// To add support for a solver, implement the `SolverAdaptor` trait in a submodule.
//
// If incremental solving support is required, also implement a new `ModelModifier`. If this is not
// required, all `ModelModifier` instances required by the SolverAdaptor trait can be replaced with
// NotModifiable.
//
// For more details, see the docstrings for SolverAdaptor, ModelModifier, and NotModifiable.
