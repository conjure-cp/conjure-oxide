/// Rewrites the given model by applying a set of rules to all its constraints.

/// It returns a modified version of the model with all applicable rules applied, ensuring that any side-effects
/// such as updates to the symbol table and top-level constraints are properly reflected in the returned model.
///
/// # Parameters
/// - `model`: A reference to the [`Model`] to be rewritten. The function will clone this model to produce a modified version.
/// - `rule_sets`: A vector of references to [`RuleSet`]s that define the rules to be applied to the model's constraints.
///   Each `RuleSet` is expected to contain a collection of rules that can transform one or more constraints
///   within the model. The lifetime parameter `'a` ensures that the rules' references are valid for the
///   duration of the function execution.
///
/// # Returns
/// - `Ok(Model)`: If successful, it returns a modified copy of the [`Model`] after all applicable rules have been
///   applied. This new model includes any side-effects such as updates to the symbol table or modifications
///   to the constraints.
/// - `Err(RewriteError)`: If an error occurs during rule application (e.g., invalid rules or failed constraints),
///   it returns a [`RewriteError`] with details about the failure.
///
/// # Side-Effects
/// - When the model is rewritten, related data structures such as the symbol table (which tracks variable names and types)
///   or other top-level constraints may also be updated to reflect these changes. These updates are applied to the returned model,
///   ensuring that all related components stay consistent and aligned with the changes made during the rewrite.
/// - The function collects statistics about the rewriting process, including the number of rule applications
///   and the total runtime of the rewriter. These statistics are then stored in the model's context for
///   performance monitoring and analysis.
///
/// # Example
/// - Using `rewrite_model` with the Expression `a + min(x, y)`
///
///   Initial expression: a + min(x, y)
///   A model containing the expression is created. The variables of the model are represented by a SymbolTable and contain a,x,y.
///   The contraints of the initail model is the expression itself.
///
///   After getting the rules by their priorities and getting additional statistics the while loop of single interations is executed.
///   Details for this process can be found in [`rewrite_iteration`] documentation.
///
///   The loop is exited only when no more rules can be applied, when rewrite_iteration returns None and [`while let Some(step) = None`] occurs
///
///
///   Will result in side effects ((d<=x ^ d<=y) being the [`new_top`] and the model will now be a conjuction of that and (a+d)
///   Rewritten expression: ((a + d) ^ (d<=x ^ d<=y))
///
/// # Performance Considerations
/// - The function checks if optimizations are enabled before applying rules, which may affect the performance
///   of the rewriting process.
/// - Depending on the size of the model and the number of rules, the rewriting process might take a significant
///   amount of time. Use the statistics collected (`rewriter_run_time` and `rewriter_rule_application_attempts`)
///   to monitor and optimize performance.
///
/// # Panics
/// - This function may panic if the model's context is unavailable or if there is an issue with locking the context.
///
/// # See Also
/// - [`get_rule_priorities`]: Retrieves the priorities for the given rules.
/// - [`rewrite_iteration`]: Executes a single iteration of rewriting the model using the specified rules.

/// - `rules`: A vector of references to [`Rule`]s that define the transformations to apply to the expression.
/// - `apply_optimizations`: A boolean flag that indicates whether optimization checks should be applied during the rewriting process.
///   If `true`, the function skips already "clean" (fully optimized or processed) expressions and marks them accordingly

/// - `stats`: A mutable reference to [`RewriterStats`] to collect statistics about the rule application process, such as

///
/// # Returns
/// - `Some(<Reduction>)`: A [`Reduction`] containing the new expression and any associated modifications if a rule was applied

/// - `None`: If no rule is applicable to the expression or any of its sub-expressions.
///
/// # Side-Effects
/// - If `apply_optimizations` is enabled, the function will skip "clean" expressions and mark successfully rewritten
///   expressions as "dirty". This is done to avoid unnecessary recomputation of expressions that have already been
///   optimized or processed.
///
/// # Example
/// - Recursively applying [`rewrite_iteration`]  to [`a + min(x, y)`]
///
///   Initially [`if apply_optimizations && expression.is_clean()`] is not true yet since intially our expression is dirty.
///
///   [`apply_results`] returns a null vector since no rules can be applied at the top level.
///   After calling function [`children`] on the expression a vector of sub-expression [`[a, min(x, y)]`] is returned.
///
///   The function iterates through the vector of the children from the top expression and calls itself.
///
///   [rewrite_iteration] on on the child [`a`] returns None, but on [`min(x, y)`] returns a [`Reduction`] object [`red`].
///   In this case, a rule (min simplification) can apply:
///   - d is added to the SymbolTable and the variables field is updated in the model. new_top is the side effects: (d<=x ^ d<=y)
///   - [`red = Reduction::new(new_expression = d, new_top, symbols)`];
///   - [`sub[1] = red.new_expression`] - Updates the second element in the vector of sub-expressions from [`min(x, y)`] to [`d`]
///
///   Since a child expression [`min(x, y)`] was rewritten to d, the parent expression [`a + min(x, y)`] is updated with the new child [`a+d`].
///   New [`Reduction`] is returned containing the modifications
///
///   The condition [`Some(step) = Some(new reduction)`] in the while loop in [`rewrite_model`] is met -> side effects are applied.
///
///   No more rules in our example can apply to the modified model -> mark all the children as clean and return a pure [`Reduction`].
///   [`return Some(Reduction::pure(expression))`]
///
///   On the last execution of rewrite_iteration condition [`apply_optimizations && expression.is_clean()`] is met, [`None`] is returned.
///
///
/// # Notes
/// - This function works recursively, meaning it traverses all sub-expressions within the given `expression` to find the
