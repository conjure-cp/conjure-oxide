/// Rewrites the given model by applying a set of rules to all its constraints, until no more rules can be applied.
///
/// Rules are applied in order of priority (from highest to lowest)
/// Rules can:
/// - Apply transformations to the constraints in the model (or their sub-expressions)
/// - Add new constraints to the model
/// - Modify the symbol table (e.g. add new variables)
///
/// # Parameters
/// - `model`: A reference to the [`Model`] to be rewritten.
/// - `rule_sets`: A vector of references to [`RuleSet`]s to be applied.
///
/// Each `RuleSet` contains a map of rules to priorities.
///
/// # Returns
/// - `Ok(Model)`: If successful, it returns a modified copy of the [`Model`]
/// - `Err(RewriteError)`: If an error occurs during rule application (e.g., invalid rules)
///
/// # Side-Effects
/// - Rules can apply side-effects to the model (e.g. adding new constraints or variables).
///   The original model is cloned and a modified copy is returned.
/// - Rule engine statistics (e.g. number of rule applications, run time) are collected and stored in the new model's context.
///
/// # Example
/// - Using `rewrite_model` with the constraint `(a + min(x, y)) = b`
///
///   Original model:
///   ```text
///   model: {
///     constraints: [(a + min(x, y) + 42 - 10) = b],
///     symbols: [a, b, x, y]
///   }
///   rule_sets: [{
///       name: "MyRuleSet",
///       rules: [
///         min_to_var: 10,
///         const_eval: 20
///       ]
///     }]
///   ```
///
///   Rules:
///   - `min_to_var`: min([a, b]) ~> c ; c <= a & c <= b & (c = a \/ c = b)
///   - `const_eval`: c1 + c2 ~> (c1 + c2) ; c1, c2 are constants
///
///   Result:
///   ```text
///   model: {
///     constraints: [
///       (a + aux + 32) = b,
///       aux <= x,
///       aux <= y,
///       aux = x \/ aux = y
///     ],
///     symbols: [a, b, x, y, aux]
///   }
///   ```
///
///   Process:
///   1. We traverse the expression tree until a rule can be applied.
///   2. If multiple rules can be applied to the same expression, the higher priority one goes first.
///      In this case, `const_eval` is applied before `min_to_var`.
///   3. The rule `min_to_var` adds a new variable `aux` and new constraints to the model.
///   4. When no more rules can be applied, the resulting model is returned.
///
///   Details for this process can be found in [`rewrite_iteration`] documentation.
///
/// # Performance Considerations
/// - We recursively traverse the tree multiple times to check if any rules can be applied.
/// - Expressions are cloned on each rule application
///
/// This can be expensive for large models
///
/// # Panics
/// - This function may panic if the model's context is unavailable or if there is an issue with locking the context.
///
/// # See Also
/// - [`get_rules`]: Resolves the rules from the provided rule sets and sorts them by priority.
/// - [`rewrite_iteration`]: Executes a single iteration of rewriting the model using the specified rules.
