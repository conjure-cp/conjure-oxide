/// A structure representing a set of rules with a name, priority, and dependencies.
///
/// `RuleSet` is a way to group related rules together under a single name.
/// You can think of it like a list of rules that belong to the same category.
/// Each `RuleSet` can also have a number that tells it what order it should run in compared to other `RuleSet` instances.
/// Additionally, a `RuleSet` can depend on other `RuleSet` instances, meaning it needs them to run first.
///
/// To make things efficient, `RuleSet` only figures out its rules and dependencies the first time they're needed,
/// and then it remembers them so it doesn't have to do the work again.
///
/// # Fields
/// - `name`: The name of the rule set.
/// - `order`: A number that decides the order in which this `RuleSet` should be applied.
///   If two `RuleSet` instances have the same rule but with different priorities,
///   the one with the higher `order` number will be the one that is used.
/// - `rules`: A lazily initialized map of rules to their priorities.
/// - `dependency_rs_names`: The names of the rule sets that this rule set depends on.
/// - `dependencies`: A lazily initialized set of `RuleSet` dependencies.
/// - `solver_families`: The solver families that this rule set applies to.
