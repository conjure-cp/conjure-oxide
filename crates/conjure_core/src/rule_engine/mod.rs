/// This procedural macro registers a decorated function with `conjure_rules`' global registry, and
/// adds the rule to one or more `RuleSet`'s.
///
/// It may be used in any downstream crate.
/// For more information on linker magic, see the [`linkme`](https://docs.rs/linkme/latest/linkme/) crate.
///
/// **IMPORTANT**: Since the resulting rule may not be explicitly referenced, it may be removed by the compiler's dead code elimination.
/// To prevent this, you must ensure that either:
/// 1. codegen-units is set to 1, i.e. in Cargo.toml:
/// ```toml
/// [profile.release]
/// codegen-units = 1
/// ```
/// 2. The function is included somewhere else in the code
///
/// <hr>
///
/// Functions must have the signature `fn(&Expr) -> ApplicationResult`.
/// The created rule will have the same name as the function.
///
/// Intermediary static variables are created to allow for the decentralized registry, with the prefix `CONJURE_GEN_`.
/// Please ensure that other variable names in the same scope do not conflict with these.
///
/// This macro must decorate a function with the given signature.
/// As arguments, it excepts a tuple of 2-tuples in the format:
/// `((<RuleSet name>, <Priority in RuleSet>), ...)`
///
/// <hr>
///
/// For example:
/// ```rust
/// use conjure_core::ast::Expression;
/// use conjure_core::ast::SymbolTable;
/// use conjure_core::rule_engine::{ApplicationError, ApplicationResult, Reduction};
/// use conjure_core::rule_engine::register_rule;
///
/// #[register_rule(("RuleSetName", 10))]
/// fn identity(expr: &Expression, symbols: &SymbolTable) -> ApplicationResult {
///   Ok(Reduction::pure(expr.clone()))
/// }

/// This procedural macro registers a rule set with the global registry.
/// It may be used in any downstream crate.
///
/// For more information on linker magic, see the [`linkme`](https://docs.rs/linkme/latest/linkme/) crate.
///
/// This macro uses the following syntax:
///
/// ```text
/// register_rule_set!(<RuleSet name>, (<DependencyRuleSet1>, <DependencyRuleSet2>, ...), <SolverFamily>);
/// ```
///
/// # Example
///
/// Register a rule set with no dependencies:
///
/// ```rust
/// use conjure_core::rule_engine::register_rule_set;
/// register_rule_set!("MyRuleSet");
/// ```
///
/// Register a rule set with dependencies:
///
/// ```rust
/// use conjure_core::rule_engine::register_rule_set;
/// register_rule_set!("MyRuleSet", ("DependencyRuleSet", "AnotherRuleSet"));
/// ```
///
/// Register a rule set for a specific solver family or families:
///
/// ```rust
/// use conjure_core::rule_engine::register_rule_set;
/// use conjure_core::solver::SolverFamily;
/// register_rule_set!("MyRuleSet", (), SolverFamily::Minion);
/// register_rule_set!("AnotherRuleSet", (), (SolverFamily::Minion, SolverFamily::SAT));
