/// Represents the result of applying a rule to an expression within a model.
///
/// A `Reduction` encapsulates the changes made to a model during a rule application.
/// It includes a new expression to replace the original one, an optional top-level constraint
/// to be added to the model, and any updates to the model's symbol table.
///
/// This struct allows for representing side-effects of rule applications, ensuring that
/// all modifications, including symbol table expansions and additional constraints, are
/// accounted for and can be applied to the model consistently.
///
/// # Fields
/// - `new_expression`: The updated [`Expression`] that replaces the original one after applying the rule.
/// - `new_top`: An additional top-level [`Vec<Expression>`] constraint that should be added to the model. If no top-level
///   constraint is needed, this field can be set to an empty vector [`Vec::new()`].
/// - `symbols`: A [`SymbolTable`] containing any new symbol definitions or modifications to be added to the model's
///   symbol table. If no symbols are modified, this field can be set to an empty symbol table.
///
/// # Usage
/// A `Reduction` can be created using one of the provided constructors:
/// - [`Reduction::new`]: Creates a reduction with a new expression, top-level constraint, and symbol modifications.
/// - [`Reduction::pure`]: Creates a reduction with only a new expression and no side-effects on the symbol table or constraints.
/// - [`Reduction::with_symbols`]: Creates a reduction with a new expression and symbol table modifications, but no top-level constraint.
/// - [`Reduction::with_top`]: Creates a reduction with a new expression and a top-level constraint, but no symbol table modifications.
///
/// The `apply` method allows for applying the changes represented by the `Reduction` to a [`Model`].
///
/// # Example
/// ```
/// // Need to add an example
/// ```
///
/// # See Also
/// - [`ApplicationResult`]: Represents the result of applying a rule, which may either be a `Reduction` or an `ApplicationError`.
/// - [`Model`]: The structure to which the `Reduction` changes are applied.
