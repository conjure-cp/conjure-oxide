# 1) build-environment: a container that sets up the build environment needed
#    to compile conjure oxide.
#
#    This stage can be used as the container for Github workflows that involve
#    building Conjure Oxide e.g. nightly releases, testing.
#
#    This uses an older version of glibc, 2.8, to ensure the build binary is
#    widely runnable on many linux systems. For more details on supported
#    systems, see manylinux_2_28 documentation.

# --platform=$TARGETPLATFORM is for podman compatibility

# download wget for downloading node below, and zip for our nightly build CI.
RUN yum install -y wget zip;

# llvm / clang: for C++ dependencies (Minion, SAT) and bindgen.
# using clang not gcc as Rust's bindgen library requires libclang
RUN yum install -y llvm-toolset;

# nodejs: required to build treesitter grammar

# treesitter builds fail on the version of node found in this containers
# package manager, as it is very old. Installing node from a binary download
# instead.

# gets these, we can trivially make this container multi-platform by commenting
# out the below elif.
