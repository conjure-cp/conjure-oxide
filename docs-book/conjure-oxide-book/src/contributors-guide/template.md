# Chapter [number]: Short title

Code block:
<!-- the ignore means it cant be run -->
```rust,ignore 
fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let y = 6;

    println!("{}", x + y);
}
```

This only works with rust code blocks. There are [different ways to include code](https://books.irust.net/read/mdbook-guide/en-us/guide/reading.html).

this will be filled with other random format bits, tho honestly people could just look at the md docs, and this template could just have the tags or something
